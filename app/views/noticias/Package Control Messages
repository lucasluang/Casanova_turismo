EJS 2
-----

  Thanks for installing EJS 2 :)
  
  Here are some tips to help you get started with this package:
  
  
  ### Color Scheme
  
  EJS 2 comes with the "Dracula EJS" color scheme which you can select from:
  `Preferences` -> `Color Scheme` -> `EJS 2`.
  
  Oceanic Next (https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) is also a
  good color scheme for EJS that works right out of the box.
  
  
  ### Setting the default syntax
  
  By default, files with the extension `.ejs` are opened with the `EJS (<% %>)` syntax.
  
  If you'd like to open files with a different extension as EJS or you want to use delimiters
  other than "<% %>", follow these steps to set the default EJS syntax for an extension:
  
  1. Open an EJS file
  2. Select `View` from the menu
  3. Then `Syntax` -> `Open all with current extension as...` -> `EJS 2` -> `EJS (<delimiter>)`
  4. Repeat this for each extension you want to open as EJS
  
  This package includes syntax definitions for the following additional delimiters: `<? ?>`, `<$ $>`, `<@ @>`.
  
  
  ### Snippets
  
  In the HTML scope:
  
  + `if`+`TAB` - Inserts EJS `if` statement
  + `for`+`TAB` - Inserts EJS `for` loop
